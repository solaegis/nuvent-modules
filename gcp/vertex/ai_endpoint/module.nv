    type: boolean
    description: "If true, the endpoint will be exposed through a dedicated DNS [Endpoint.dedicated_endpoint_dns]. Your request to the dedicated DNS will be isolated from other users' traffic and will have better performance and reliability. Note: Once you enabled dedicated endpoint, you won't be able to send request to the shared DNS {region}-aiplatform.googleapis.com. The limitation will be removed soon."
